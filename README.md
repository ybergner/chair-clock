# Session Chair Clock Web App

A simple and responsive web app that functions as a countdown timer for session chairs, speakers, and presenters. The timer changes color to indicate the time remaining and provides controls to set the total time, color-change times, start, stop, and reset the countdown.

## Features

- Customizable countdown timer
- Color changes to indicate time remaining:
  - Green: normal countdown
  - Yellow: warning (user-defined)
  - Red: critical (user-defined)
  - Flashing red/orange: final minute
  - Flashing red and black: time's up (clock shows -1:0-1 which is kind of a bug, but I like it)
- Responsive design: clock text resizes based on the viewport size
- Controls to set total time, yellow and red warning times, start, stop, and reset the countdown

## Usage

Customize the countdown timer by entering the desired total time and color-change times. Click "Start" to begin the countdown, "Stop" to pause, and "Reset" to reset the timer.

## Disclosure

ChatGPT was used to help write this app. If there's something weird in it, or if it activates a sleeper cell of AI robots in your vicinity, leading to massive destruction when you use it, I'm sorry.
